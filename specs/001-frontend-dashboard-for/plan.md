# Implementation Plan: Hummingbot Dashboard Frontend

**Branch**: `001-frontend-dashboard-for` | **Date**: October 12, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-frontend-dashboard-for/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Web-based dashboard for monitoring and controlling Hummingbot trading bot instances, providing real-time portfolio visualization, bot configuration management, market data analysis, and system monitoring. Built with React 18+ and Next.js 15, featuring interactive charts, responsive design, and secure integration with the Hummingbot API.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Node.js 24.x LTS  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Next.js 15, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Chart.js, Zustand, React Query  
**Storage**: Browser localStorage/sessionStorage for preferences, secure server-side credential storage  
**Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end testing, Vitest with React Testing Library for unit tests  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile
**Project Type**: web - frontend dashboard application  
**Performance Goals**: <3s portfolio load time, <200ms UI response, <5s real-time data latency  
**Constraints**: JWT/session-based authentication, 100+ concurrent bot instances support, financial data precision  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user trading dashboard, WebSocket with polling fallback, Zustand + React Query state management

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: DEFERRED - Constitution file contains only template placeholders. Project proceeds under standard web application practices:
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI library
- Test-driven development with unit and E2E testing
- API-first integration design with OpenAPI contracts
- Performance monitoring and optimization targets defined

**Structure Decision**: Next.js 15 web application structure using app router for modern React patterns, shadcn/ui for consistent component library, and comprehensive testing setup with Playwright for user flow validation.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
