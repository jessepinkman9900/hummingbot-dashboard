# Research: Hummingbot Dashboard Frontend

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Feature**: Hummingbot Dashboard Frontend

## Chart Library Selection

**Decision**: Recharts with Chart.js fallback for complex financial charts

**Rationale**: 
- Recharts provides React-native integration with good performance for real-time data
- Declarative API fits well with React patterns
- Built-in support for financial chart types (candlestick, line, area)
- Chart.js can handle more complex visualizations like order book depth charts
- Both libraries have strong community support and documentation

**Alternatives considered**:
- D3.js (too complex for this scope, steep learning curve)
- Victory (good but less performant for real-time updates)
- Lightweight-charts (TradingView library, excellent but vendor lock-in concerns)

## Unit Testing Framework

**Decision**: Vitest with React Testing Library

**Rationale**:
- Vitest provides fast unit testing with native TypeScript support
- React Testing Library promotes best practices for component testing
- Excellent integration with Next.js and modern tooling
- Fast test execution important for TDD workflow
- Built-in code coverage reporting

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest (slower than Vitest, more configuration needed)
- Cypress Component Testing (good but heavier for unit tests)

## Real-time Data Strategy

**Decision**: WebSocket connection with polling fallback

**Rationale**:
- WebSocket provides low-latency real-time updates for portfolio and market data
- Polling fallback ensures reliability when WebSocket connection fails
- Progressive enhancement approach - start with polling, upgrade to WebSocket
- Allows graceful degradation in poor network conditions
- Fits with financial data requirements for timely updates

**Alternatives considered**:
- Polling only (higher latency, more server load)
- Server-Sent Events (simpler but one-way communication only)
- WebRTC (overkill for this use case)

## State Management

**Decision**: Zustand with React Query for server state

**Rationale**:
- Zustand provides lightweight global state management without boilerplate
- React Query handles server state caching, synchronization, and background updates
- Excellent TypeScript support for type-safe state management
- React Query's optimistic updates work well for trading interfaces
- Minimal learning curve compared to Redux

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit (more boilerplate, steeper learning curve)
- Jotai (atom-based approach, might be overkill)
- Pure React Context (doesn't handle server state well)

## Authentication Implementation

**Decision**: NextAuth.js with custom Hummingbot API provider

**Rationale**:
- NextAuth.js provides secure session management out of the box
- Custom provider can integrate with Hummingbot API authentication
- Built-in CSRF protection and secure cookie handling
- Supports JWT and database sessions flexibly
- Mature library with good security practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom JWT implementation (more security risks, reinventing wheel)
- Auth0 (external dependency, additional cost)
- Supabase Auth (external dependency, not needed for this scope)

## Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback for component optimization, React Query for data caching

**Rationale**:
- React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders of expensive chart components
- Memoization hooks prevent recalculation of complex financial calculations
- React Query provides intelligent caching and background synchronization
- Code splitting with Next.js dynamic imports for large chart libraries
- Service Worker for caching static assets and API responses

**Alternatives considered**:
- No optimization (would not meet performance requirements)
- Manual optimization only (inconsistent, error-prone)
- Third-party performance libraries (additional dependencies)
