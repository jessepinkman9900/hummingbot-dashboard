# Specification Quality Checklist: Hummingbot Dashboard Frontend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 12, 2025
**Feature**: [Hummingbot Dashboard Frontend](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Validation Status**: PASSED - All checklist items completed successfully
- **Technology Stack**: Appropriately constrained in Constraints section rather than mixed with functional requirements
- **Scope Boundaries**: Clear separation between in-scope and out-of-scope items provides good project boundaries
- **Success Criteria**: All criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic, focusing on user outcomes rather than technical metrics
- **Dependencies**: Well-identified external dependencies that could impact project success
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive coverage of potential system failure scenarios and boundary conditions

**READY FOR NEXT PHASE**: This specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
