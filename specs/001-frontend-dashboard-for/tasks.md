# Tasks: Hummingbot Dashboard Frontend

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-frontend-dashboard-for/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Include Playwright end-to-end tests as requested in spec.md: "Implement each feature end to end and write tests using playwright to test the user flows"

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 for portfolio updates
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Required by US1 and US2 for account data
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Monitors components from all other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Types before API clients
- API clients before stores
- Stores before components
- Components before pages
- Core implementation before WebSocket integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Types and API clients within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "E2E test for portfolio dashboard loading in tests/e2e/portfolio.spec.ts"
Task: "E2E test for portfolio real-time updates in tests/e2e/portfolio-realtime.spec.ts"
Task: "Unit test for portfolio API client in tests/unit/api/portfolio.test.ts"
Task: "Unit test for portfolio store in tests/unit/store/portfolio.test.ts"

# Launch all types for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Portfolio types in src/lib/types/portfolio.ts"
Task: "Create AssetBalance types in src/lib/types/asset.ts"

# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create portfolio overview component in src/components/portfolio/portfolio-overview.tsx"
Task: "Create asset distribution chart component in src/components/charts/asset-distribution-chart.tsx"
Task: "Create PnL chart component in src/components/charts/pnl-chart.tsx"
Task: "Create portfolio metrics component in src/components/portfolio/portfolio-metrics.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Portfolio Visualization)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo portfolio dashboard

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Bot Management)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Market Analysis)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Account Management)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (System Monitoring)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Portfolio)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Bots)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Market Data)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Accounts)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Monitoring)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Special requirement: Use shadcn Kodama Grove theme as requested
- Playwright tests are mandatory per spec.md requirements
- Focus on financial data precision and real-time updates
- Ensure responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile
