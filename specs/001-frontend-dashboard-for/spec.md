# Feature Specification: Hummingbot Dashboard Frontend

**Feature Branch**: `001-frontend-dashboard-for`  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Frontend dashboard for Hummingbot API control center with React/NextJS 15, featuring chart visualization, settings, configuration management, and SaaS-style UI components"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

Implement each feature end to end ans write tests using playwright to test the user flows
Once it is functional only then move on to the next user story

### User Story 1 - Real-time Portfolio Visualization (Priority: P1)

A trader opens the dashboard and immediately sees their current portfolio state across all connected exchanges, with real-time balance updates, profit/loss indicators, and performance charts.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - traders need instant visibility into their financial status across all bots and exchanges to make informed decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting to the portfolio API endpoints and displaying mock data with charts, delivering immediate visual feedback on portfolio performance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has active bot instances, **When** they open the dashboard, **Then** they see real-time portfolio overview with total balance, PnL, and asset distribution
2. **Given** portfolio data is loading, **When** API responds, **Then** charts update smoothly without page refresh
3. **Given** no active connections, **When** user visits dashboard, **Then** they see empty state with clear call-to-action to set up first bot

---

### User Story 2 - Bot Configuration Management (Priority: P2)

A trader configures and manages their market-making bots through an intuitive interface, setting up trading pairs, parameters, and risk limits without touching configuration files.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability - reduces technical barrier and enables non-technical users to operate bots effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by implementing bot configuration forms that validate inputs and communicate with the bot orchestration API.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants to create a new bot, **When** they use the configuration wizard, **Then** they can set up a complete bot configuration through guided steps
2. **Given** user has existing bots, **When** they view bot management page, **Then** they see all bots with status, performance metrics, and quick actions
3. **Given** invalid configuration parameters, **When** user tries to save, **Then** they receive clear validation feedback and correction guidance

---

### User Story 3 - Market Data Analysis (Priority: P2)

A trader analyzes market conditions and bot performance through interactive charts showing price movements, order book depth, and trading history to optimize bot strategies.

**Why this priority**: Critical for strategy optimization - traders need data visualization to understand market conditions and bot effectiveness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing chart components that consume market data API endpoints and display historical and real-time market information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects a trading pair, **When** they view market analysis, **Then** they see price charts, volume indicators, and order book visualization
2. **Given** user wants to analyze bot performance, **When** they access performance dashboard, **Then** they see profit/loss charts, trade history, and key metrics
3. **Given** real-time market data is available, **When** user enables live updates, **Then** charts update automatically with new data points

---

### User Story 4 - Account and Exchange Management (Priority: P3)

A trader manages multiple exchange connections, API credentials, and account settings through a secure interface that handles authentication and configuration storage.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for multi-exchange trading - enables users to connect and manage multiple trading venues securely.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing account management forms that interact with the accounts API to add, remove, and validate exchange connections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants to add exchange connection, **When** they provide API credentials, **Then** system validates connection and stores credentials securely
2. **Given** user has multiple accounts, **When** they view account overview, **Then** they see all connected exchanges with connection status and recent activity
3. **Given** API credentials are invalid, **When** user attempts operations, **Then** they receive clear error messages and guidance to fix connection issues

---

### User Story 5 - System Monitoring and Alerts (Priority: P3)

A trader monitors system health, bot status, and receives notifications about important events like stopped bots, connection issues, or significant market movements.

**Why this priority**: Operational reliability - ensures traders stay informed about system status and can respond quickly to issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing status monitoring components that display system health indicators and notification management interfaces.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** system components are running, **When** user checks system status, **Then** they see health indicators for Docker, bots, and API connections
2. **Given** bot encounters error, **When** error occurs, **Then** user receives notification with error details and suggested actions
3. **Given** user wants to customize alerts, **When** they access notification settings, **Then** they can configure alert preferences and delivery methods

### Edge Cases

- What happens when API connection is lost during active trading?
- How does system handle displaying data when multiple time zones are involved?
- What occurs when bot configurations conflict with exchange trading rules?
- How does interface respond when market data feeds experience delays?
- What happens when user has insufficient permissions for certain operations?
